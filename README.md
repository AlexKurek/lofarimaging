# LOFAR LBA imaging tutorial
Basic LOFAR imaging with an LBA station, based on the tutorial provided by Michiel Brentjens (github.com/brentjens). This notebook is compatible with Python 2.7.

### To start the notebook
`>> jupyter notebook`

### To run the entire notebook
`Kernel > Restart & Run All`

### Notes
This ships with an example dataset (20170720_095816_xst.dat), obtained using station DE603LBA, specifically collecting data in subband 297 (58 MHz). It should run on any other dataset, provided the station name and subband are changed accordingly. By default, it visualises timestep #5 of the 30 timesteps of integration, but this can also be modified to any other time slice.
